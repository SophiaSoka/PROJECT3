/*
 * Algorithm: This is our start menu which will prompt the user and give instructions as the user progresses through the game
 * Prompt the user with the difficulty they want to select by using if statements inside a while loop
 * Included the merchant which will prompt the user on wha they can purchase for their journey
 * Used a while loop to display the user with options throughout the game if they want to move, see inventory, or quit
 * Used a switch statement for the user's movement throughout the map
 * In the switch statement the user is prompted if they run into a pirate, a trap, want to see their inventory, etc. with while loops and if statements
